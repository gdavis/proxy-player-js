# Proxy Player JS
Proxy Player JS is an HTML5 video with Flash fallback solution that enables video playback on all major platforms and mobile devices. Why are we making another HTML5 video solution when there are other great libraries like VideoJS, MediaElement, and VideoForEverybody? Proxy Player JS allows HTML/Javascript/CSS based controls to interact with both the HTML5 video element and a Flash Player object, depending on the needs of the platform. In the other HTML5 video solutions, a Flash fallback is used which includes its own Actionscript-based set of controls, which will often look very different than the HTML controls for the player.
	
As an advertising agency, branding and custom UIs for our video players are paramount to an immersive, professional user experience for our clients and their customers. Other video solutions demand twice as much development time to create custom styled controls for both the HTML and Flash-based players. Proxy Player eliminates the need to develop two sets of controls by using a proxy object respond to HTML/Javascript/CSS controls and forwards those interactions to either an HTML5 video object, or Flash Player. 

Proxy Player aims to be a solution to not only save the developer time in developing controls, but also in handling the many bugs and gotchas that appear across all the different platforms when dealing with HTML5 video. Based on the MVC design pattern, it is also meant to be flexible enough to extend and provide custom controls, or listen to player events from outside of the player altogether to have other page elements respond to those events. 
	
## The Guts 
Proxy Player is made up of many different Javascript based "classes" that are all concatenated into a minified JS file for easy deployment. Proxy Player makes use of the Prototype javascript framework's class and inheritance structure. For more information, visit: http://www.prototypejs.org/learn/class-inheritance. ProxyPlayer makes use of this OOP-based approach to provide a more formal architecture for inheriting, extending, overriding functionality.

The main classes in ProxyPlayer.js:

**FVideo.js**
Acts as the "controller" for the MVC pattern. Provides the base API for interacting with the video. The main API actions (such as play, pause, stop) are forwarded to the Proxy object created to control the video player.

**FVideoModel.js**
Acts as the "model" for the video player. 

**FControls.js**
Manages all controls added to the player. Responsible for building, placing, and resizing controls.

**FControl.js**
Base class for all UI controls. Provides a set of methods to override to build controls.

**Proxy.js**
Base class for the HTMLProxy and FlashProxy classes. Provides a set of methods that interact with the "view"; either the HTML5 video tag or Flash Player object.

**HTMLProxy.js**
Proxy subclass that interacts with the HTML5 <video> tag.

**FlashProxy.js**
Proxy subclass that interacts with the Flash Player object via ExternalInterface.

## Usage

## Platform Notes

### iOS 3

There are several known bugs using HTML5 video with iOS3. Under iOS3, the player will ignore custom controls and force using the system's controls. This is due to the following issues under iOS3:

* After injecting the video tag via javascript you canâ€™t put anything on top of the video. This renders controls that display on top of the player useless.
* The video tag will capture all click and touch events for elements on top of video object. For example, if you were to get around the previous issue and get your controls to render on top of your video, the controls won't receive any events.

So when viewing the player under iOS3, it is expected behavior to only see the default browser controls.
